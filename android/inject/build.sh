# `vortex_inject` is a ~20 KB arm64 binary that the laptop app pushes to
# /data/local/tmp over adb (see linux/ui-tauri/src-tauri/src/mirror_inject.rs).
# It is committed in built form, because `include_bytes!` needs it at compile
# time and asking every Linux user to install the Android NDK to get a working
# mouse would be absurd. A committed binary that nobody can reproduce is a
# different problem, though — hence this script.

#   OUT=/tmp/x android/inject/build.sh   # somewhere else, to compare
#
# REPRODUCIBLE: with NDK r26b and API 29 the output is byte-for-byte identical
# to the committed binary, so you can verify the one in the repo rather than
# trust it:
#
#   OUT=/tmp/vi android/inject/build.sh
#   cmp /tmp/vi linux/ui-tauri/src-tauri/assets/vortex_inject && echo identical
#
# A different NDK still produces a working injector, just not the same bytes.
